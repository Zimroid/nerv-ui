# NervUI

Just to start learning how to use React, non-interactive page based on a sci-fi looking UI from Evangelion.

## How it's made ?

It's a CSS grid tweaked to only display square cells.
This grid contains a bunch of checkboxes that are checked and unchecked randomly.
These checkboxes are also "linked" with a home made component that generates svgs.
